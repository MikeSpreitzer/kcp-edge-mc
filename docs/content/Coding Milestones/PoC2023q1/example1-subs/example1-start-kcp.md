### Deploy kcp and KubeStellar

You need kcp and KubeStellar and can deploy them in either of two
ways: as bare processes on whatever host you are using to run this
example, or as workload in a Kubernetes cluster (an OpenShift cluster
qualifies).  Do one or the other, not both.

KubeStellar only works with release `v0.20.0` of kcp.

### Deploy kcp and KubeStellar as bare processes

#### Start kcp

Download and build or install [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/releases/tag/v0.20.0),
according to your preference.  See the start of [the kcp quickstart](https://docs.kcp.io/kcp/v0.11/#quickstart) for instructions on that, but get [release v0.20.0](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/releases/tag/v0.20.0) rather than the latest (the downloadable assets appear after the long list of changes/features/etc).

In some shell that will be used only for this purpose, issue the `kcp
start` command.  If you have junk from previous runs laying around,
you should probably `rm -rf .kcp` first.

In the shell commands in all the following steps it is assumed that
`kcp` is running and `$KUBECONFIG` is set to the
`.kcp/admin.kubeconfig` that `kcp` produces, except where explicitly
noted that the florin or guilder cluster is being accessed.

It is also assumed that you have the usual kcp kubectl plugins on your
`$PATH`.

clone the v0.20.0 branch kcp source:
```shell
git clone -b v0.20.0 https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp kcp
```
build the kubectl-ws binary and include it in `$PATH`
```shell
pushd kcp
make build
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH
```

Run the kcp server in a forked shell.  Even though the subcommand is "start", it does not just launch the server, it continues with running the server.
```shell
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/.kcp/admin.kubeconfig
kcp start &> /tmp/kcp.log &
popd
sleep 30 
```
